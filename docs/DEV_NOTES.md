## Arthur - 21/10/2023 - Integrating Apache airflow

### Description - Integrating Apache airflow

I initialized tha airflow stack and learned how to use it very basically.
I don't have found a answer yet but I'm asking if the scripts or services to execute should be created and managed in the airflow stack (like the demo seem to indicate) or
if we should keep our services isolated from the airflow stack and just use airflow to run them.
If it's the second option, I'll have to find a way to manage the services from the airflow stack.
I hadn't found yep a way to do it. Please don't hesitate to give me your opinion on this.
